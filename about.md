About me
=====================

Investment banker (TMT, incidentally :) turned programmer / hacker. Tend
to work with clusters of machines doing high performance analytics work,
and these notes reflect stuff i've learnt--often the hard way-- along
that journey.

Stuff I tend to code in:
* Python
* JavaScript
* Java
* Bash

Stuff I can code in (but dont usually):
* C++
* Prolog
